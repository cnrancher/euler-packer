# Packer Build Scripts for openEuler

## Purpose

These scripts are used to create openEuler cloud image for AWS.

The generated AMI images can be found in `ap-northeast-1` (Tokyo) and `ca-central-1` (Canada) region.
You can edit the configuration files in [openeuler/aws/*.json](openeuler/aws/) to customize the region of the generated AMI images.

> AMI name begin with `DEV` is the "Base AMI Image" of openEuler, **this AMI image is not recommended to use in production**.
> AMI name without `DEV` is configured to install `cloud-init` and other packages, the installation script is [scripts/openeuler/packer/ami-install-cloud-init.sh](scripts/openeuler/packer/ami-install-cloud-init.sh)

## Usage

**Required OS**: Linux is required to run these scripts, MacOS and Windows are not supported since these scripts need to use `qemu-nbd` to load the partition in `qcow2` images onto system (for shrinking partition size) and `mount` the partitions (for install ENA kernel module).
The Linux distribution we use for developing this project is `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`, other distributions are not tested yet and may not working properly.

This project use `make` command to run scripts, you can run `make` command without parameter to get more information.

```text
Usage:
    make ami        - Create 'AMI image' from the base AMI image by using packer
    make harvester  - Create harvester 'acow2 image' by using packer
    make clean      - Delete temporary files in 'tmp'
```

1. Install build dependencies.

    - Ensure `make`, `docker`, `awscli`, `jq`, `qemu-utils`, `partprobe` (`parted`), `packer` and `fdisk` are installed.
    - Make sure AWS config file `~/.aws/config` and `~/.aws/credentials` are configured, and the region should be set to `ap-northeast-1` (generated by command `aws configure`).
    - Make sure `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variable are configured.

    Here is the example installation command for Ubuntu:

    ```sh
    # Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
    # Some packages may already installed before running this command
    sudo apt install make awscli jq qemu-utils parted fdisk
    ```

    <!-- Follow the [official installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) to install Docker. -->

    Following [this official installation guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/tutorials/docker-get-started/get-started-install-cli#installing-packer) to install the latest version of packer (version >= 1.7)

    Then run following commands to configure AWS Client.

    ```sh
    # Generate ~/.aws/credential
    aws configure
    # Set environment variables
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<key id>
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<secret>
    ```

    This project use `date +"%Y%m%d-%H%M"` for distinct the name of generated AMI images, **please make sure the time and timezone of your system is correct**.

    Create a AWS S3 bucket for uploading RAW images to create AWS snapshot, the name of the S3 bucket is required when runnning `make ami`.

    Clone this project:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/cnrancher/euler-packer.git && cd euler-packer
    ```

2. Use packer to create AMI image: `make ami`

    `make ami` command involves following operations:

    - Firstly, upload the shrinked image to AWS S3 bucket and create 'Base AMI image', the name format of generated AMI image name is `DEV-*-BASE`
        > You can use `SKIP_BASE_AMI=1` to skip re-build base AMI image.
    - Use `packer` to launch an EC2 instance from "Base AMI image".
    - Install `cloud-init` and other useful tools, see [scripts/openeuler-install-cloudinit](scripts/openeuler-install-cloudinit).
    - Finally convert the EBS of the instance to AWS Snapshot, and generate AMI image from it.

    ``` sh
    OPENEULER_VERSION=<version> \
        OPENEULER_ARCH=<arch> \
        AWS_BUCKET_NAME=<bucket_name> \
        AWS_BASE_AMI_OWNER_ID=<ower_id> \
        make ami
    ```

    Environment variables when executin `make ami`:

      - `OPENEULER_VERSION`: openEuler version, default is `22.03-LTS`
      - `OPENEULER_ARCH`: openEuler arch, default is `x86_64`, can be `x86_64` or `aarch64`.
      - `AWS_BUCKET_NAME`: AWS S3 Bucket name, **required**
      <!-- - `AWS_BASE_AMI`: base AMI ID, required if not executed `make base-ami`
        This script can load base AMI ID from the output of command `make base-ami`, **so this parameter is not force required if you run `make base-ami` before `make ami`**. -->
      - `AWS_BASE_AMI_OWNER_ID`: The owner ID of the base AMI image, you can find this ID from AWS console panel, **this variable is force required**.

3. Finally packer will create an AMI image with its name format `openEuler-<VERSION>-<ARCH>-hvm-<DATETIME>`.

## Others

<!-- - If `make base-image` failed when trying to download/uncompress `qcow.xz` archive file, run `make clean` before re-run `make base-image`.

- If `make base-image` failed when resizing partition size, and `/dev/nbd0` is loaded on your system, run following command before re-run `make base-image`:

    ``` sh
    sudo qemu-nbd -d /dev/nbd0
    ```

- `make base-image` may fail when shirinking partition size, with error message `run 'e2fsck -f /dev/nbd0p2' first` or device is busy etc... Run following command and try to re-run `make base-image` again.

    ```sh
    # If the error message is about 'e2fsck', run:
    sudo e2fsck -f /dev/nbd0p2

    # If the error message is about 'device busy', run:
    sudo partprobe /dev/nbd0
    ```
-->

- Currently openEuler aarch64 does not have [ENA](https://github.com/amzn/amzn-drivers/tree/master/kernel/linux/ena) driver installed in kernel, this project use a workaround to download pre-build ENA kernel module and install into system when creating openEuler aarch64 RAW image.

    The ENA kernel module is installed in to `/opt/ena-driver/ena.ko`, and use `modprobe` to automatically load this kernel module when system start up. **Do not delete this file** or the EC2 instance won't connect to the internet!

- You can find the scripts to install docker at [scripts/others/install-docker.sh](scripts/others/install-docker.sh).
